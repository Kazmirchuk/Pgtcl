This is pgtcl version 1.4 alpha

With version 1.4, Pgtcl has been internally overhauled and brought up to
date with the latest Tcl C-interface technology, while maintaining
nearly 100% compatibility with the pg_* Tcl interface provided by Pgtcl 1.3.

Most Tcl programs that used Pgtcl 1.3 will work without modification
under Pgtcl 1.4.

The main changes are:

    o Support has been dropped for Tcl 7.x.  We now support Tcl 8.1 and above,
      preferably Tcl 8.3 and above.

    o All commands have now been converted to use Tcl 8-style Tcl objects.

        The result is a probable increase in performance in all routines, with
        potentially huge performance increases in pg_select and pg_execute when
        used with complex Tcl code bodies.

    o A new experimental asynchronous interface has been added

	Requests can be issued to the backend without waiting for the
	results, allowing for user interfaces to still work, etc.
	Also, requests can now be cancelled while they're in process.

    o pg_* call arguments are now checked much more rigorously.

	Code previously using atoi() for integer conversions now
	uses Tcl_GetIntFromObj, etc.

	pg_* calls with too many arguments were often accepted without
	complaint.  These now generate standard Tcl "wrong # args"
	messages, etc.

    o Error reporting has been brought into more compliance with the
      Tcl way of doing things.

So some programs that might have been working properly but had certain
syntatically incorrect pg_* commands will now fail until fixed.

pg_result -assign and pg_result -assignbyidx used to return the array
name, which was superfluous because the array name was specified on the
command line.  They now return nothing.  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
