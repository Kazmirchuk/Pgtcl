Set up error code when returning errors from postgres stuff.
Return postgres status like {POSTGRES PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY} or whatever.

Make a cursor-like thing that sits on top of postgres results.  It's
"reusable", because it knows to close out the previous result when it's
being handed a new result.

DONE Support for asynchronous operation.

Stubify the build.

Make the build TEA-compliant, including

Document pg_execute.

Document pg_on_connection_loss.

Document new asynchronous operation stuff.

Fix up new asynchronous operation stuff to use applicable Tcl internals.

Make a new command that uses the async interface but waits behind your
back through the tcl event loop, something like

    pg_query $conn query resultVar {resultCode}

It iterates the resultCode for each result found, automatically clearing
the result at the end of each iteration.

X add -list and -llist options to return list in pg_result
- add introspection commands? e.g. to return the connection handles, or result handles
