Return postgres status like {POSTGRES PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY} or whatever.

"reusable", because it knows to close out the previous result when it's
being handed a new result.

DONE Support for asynchronous operation.

Stubify the build.

Make the build TEA-compliant.

Document pg_execute.

Document new asynchronous operation stuff.
