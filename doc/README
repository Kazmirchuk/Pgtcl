libpgtcl.sgml is in docbook 4.2 format, and started out as the documentation 
from the PostgreSQL package when Pgtcl was part of the Postgres core.  

It has been updated to document the latest capabilities of Pgtcl.

The release ships with pre-generated documentation in HTML, PDF, and manpage form.

To build your own docs from the sgml source is beyond the scope of this
document.  For starters, though, you'll need openjade, pdfjadetex,
docbook 4.2, DSSSL Docbook (cygnus), and probably some other stuff.

* "make pdf" should make libpgtcl.pdf.
* "make html" should make the html subdirectory and (re)populate it with html files.
* "make man" should generate the manpages.

If you're using FreeBSD, installing the build dependencies is pretty easy.

    pkg install docbook docbook-sgml dsssl-docbook-modular openjade tex-jadetex texlive-full

There are some good hints on everything you need and how to get it built
and installed at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/docguide.html
