    * Convert all the "#ifdef TCL_ARRAYS" where tcl_value was called if 
      defined and not called if not defined to always "call" tcl_value.  
      In the case where TCL_ARRAYS isn't defined, tcl_value is now defined 
      as a macro that returns whatever was given to it, making it a no-op.

      This change allows the code to be compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG enabled
      to look for memory leaks.

    * Tagged for 1.4b2

    * Create the libpgtcl shared library in a way where it can find both 
      the Postgres shared library it needs (libpq) and the Tcl shared
      library it needs (libtcl).

    * added -list and -llist options to pg_result to return the
