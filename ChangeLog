    * added preliminary support for dicts in pg_result. Need to have
      Tcl 8.5 or the dicts package extension. Need to set            
      HAVETCL_NEWDICTOBJ manually for now.

2004-08-23 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added tcltest script of testing pgtcl.

2004-08-21 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Made the result handle into a command, and added associated command
      dispatcher.

2004-08-18 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added another way to specify the connection string to pg::connect:
      pg::connect -connlist {host myhost port myport ...}. This is similiar
      to -conninfo, except that the arg is a key value list.

    * Added -connhandle option to pg::connect to specify the connection
      handle name. If not specified, then connection handle name is
      derived by pgtcl (as before).

2004-08-16 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added Pg_results (pg::results, pg_results) command that returns
      the result handles for a particular connection

2004-08-15 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added new command pg::conninfo that returns a list of PG connection
      handles

2004-07-02 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added basic capability to use the connection handle as a command
    * since connection handle can be a command now, I made the returned
      handle namespace qualified, with respect to the calling namespace

2004-06-29 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added proper Tcl namespace support (i.e. ::pg::connect)

2004-06-28 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Version 1.4 released

2004-06-22 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Added new optional subidentifiers to pg_result $resultID -error. 
      You can specify one of "severity", "sqlstate", "primary", "detail",
      "hint", "position", "context", "file", "line", or "function" to
      get the severity (ERROR, FATAL, PANIC, WARNING, NOTICE, DEBUG,
      INFO, or LOG or a localized translation of one of these), the
      SQLSTATE code (see Appendix A of the Postgres manual), the
      primary human-readable error message, the optional secondary
      error message carrying more detail about the problem, the hint,
      an optional suggestion about what to do, the position, an error
      cursor position as an index into the original statement string
      starting from 1 (in characters, not bytes), the context,
      the source file where the error was reported, the line number of
      the source code where the error was reported, and the name
      of the source code function reporting the error, respectively.

      With newer versions of Postgres, $-variable substitution is now
      supported in pg_sendquery as it is in pg_exec.

    * Added a new function, pg_sendquery_prepared, that supports
      asynchronous invocation of prepared statements.

2004-06-21 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Added parameter support to the asynchronous pg_sendquery function.
      With newer versions of Postgres, $-variable substitution is now
      supported in pg_sendquery as it is in pg_exec.

    * Added a new function, pg_sendquery_prepared, that supports
      asynchronous invocation of prepared statements.

2004-05-26 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Changed configure script to use pg_config to find the path to
      PostgreSQL includes and libraries.

    * Altered libpgtcl to no longer require access to internal PostgreSQL
      include files.

    * Changed configure script to determine whether or not PostgreSQL 7.4+
      functions PQexecParams and PQexecPrepared are available or not.

2004-05-21 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Add pg_exec_prepared to execute pre-prepared SQL statements with 
      parameters.

2004-04-23 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Add pg_quote function to escape strings.  It adds the outside quotes, too.

2004-04-14 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Modify pg_exec to support $-variable substitution for PostgreSQL 7.4 and
      above (protocol >= 3).  For example, you can now do stuff like
          pg_exec $conn {select * from foo where field1 = $1} $value

2004-02-14  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Updated with the fixes that went into the -core libpgtcl release
    * Also added fix for WSAStartup posted by anonymous on the bug list

2003-01-14  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added -cmdTuples to pg_result (code submitted by Artur Trzewik)

2002-11-19  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * Improved the performance of -list a little bit

2002-11-15  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b3

    * Fix pg_listen.  (callback string wasn't properly terminated)
      Also made slight performance improvements in pg_listen.

2002-11-15  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * Cleanup memory leaks in pg_result.

    * Fixed bug in pg_result -assignbyidx

2002-11-15  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Convert all the "#ifdef TCL_ARRAYS" where tcl_value was called if 
      defined and not called if not defined to always "call" tcl_value.  
      In the case where TCL_ARRAYS isn't defined, tcl_value is now defined 
      as a macro that returns whatever was given to it, making it a no-op.

      This change allows the code to be compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG enabled
      to look for memory leaks.

2002-11-06  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b2

    * Create the libpgtcl shared library in a way where it can find both 
      the Postgres shared library it needs (libpq) and the Tcl shared
      library it needs (libtcl).

2002-11-05  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * added -list and -llist options to pg_result to return the
      results as a list and list of lists
